A Doctor record has doctor name(defined in Person class), 
Speciality as string(Pediatrician, Obstetrician, General Practitioner, Primary Care, Gynecologist), 
an office-visit fee(use double type). Give your class appropriate getter and accessor methods and constructors and equals method. 
Write a driver program to test all your methods.

2. Define 2 classes Patient and Billing, whose objects are records for a clinic. 
Derive Patient from class Person. 
A Patient record has patient's name(defined in Person class) and an identification number(use string type). 
A Billing object will contain a Patient object and a Doctor object. 
Give your class appropriate getter and accessor methods and constructors and equals method. 
Write a driver program to test all your methods. 
Then write a test program to create at least two Patients and 2 Doctors, 
and at least 2 Billing records and then display the total income from the Billing records.
